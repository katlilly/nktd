\section*{What we are going to build}

We intend to build an app containing a suite of games that can be
played without the use of one's hands. Entry to the app as well as
control of the games will all be voice controlled.

We will begin with a tetris game as a way to get started and learn all
the various things we'll need to learn, such as how to use the voice
to text software, how to write an android app, etc. This is a game
that has very simple keyboard inputs, so there shouldn't be
significant challenges beyond capturing the voice commands.

After this we intend to add one or more additional games. Hopefully
we'll come up with some ideas for games that are a bit more
interesting to control by voice than tetris, maybe something where the
gameplay is improved or changed by controlling it this way.

\subsubsection*{Intended users}

Our target users are anyone who does not have full use of their hands,
either permanently or temporarily. The app will be launched with the
voice control in the operating system, and the user will be able to
select a game and play it using only voice commands.

\section*{How we will build it}

Daniel has found some open source voice to text libraries that he is
working with, and we will use these to take voice commands from the
user that will control the games.

Kat found an open source cpp implementation of tetris with ASCII
graphics that she is making modifications (using ncurses.h library
functions rather than Windows.h) to so it will run in a linux/OSX
terminal. Tobyn is working on getting it to run in Windows. Kat is
also working on rewriting this in Java, which might be an easy way to
do the graphics and also gets us some of the way towards an Android
app.

Other games...?

\section*{Platforms}

We intend to make our games run both as Android apps and as terminal
based games with ASCII graphics to run on both OSX/linux and Windows.

The desktop terminal versions of the games serve as an easier way to
get started writing stuff and figuring out game logic etc before we
learn how to write Android apps.


\section*{Timeline}

Things that need doing at the moment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understanding the voice to text stuff - Daniel is working on
  this and will write a simple program that takes voice inputs and
  outputs them to screen or perhaps tries to match them to a list of
  game control commands
\item Figuring out how to get started writing an Android app - one of
  us should write a very simple app that starts up with a menu asking
  you to select which game to play
\item Getting the tetris.cpp code working in both windows and
  linux/osx, Kat and Tobyn working on this
\item Implementing tetris in Java - Kat is working on this
\item Understanding the voice controls that come with the Android
  operating system
\item Linking our slack workspace to the nktd github repo
  
\end{itemize}
